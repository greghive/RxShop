# RxShop

This is a demo project structured using functional MVVM-C, where view models and coordinators are free functions. This interesting approach was taken from [RxMyCoordinator][1] by [@danielt1263][2]. This demo was built to explore this architecture.

To login as a demo user, use feedme@rxshop.com / rxshop, or create a new account. (No data is actually stored on the server, this uses a simple Vapor project, which just echos back the user credentials you sign up with).
